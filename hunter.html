    <h1>synopsis</h1>

    <p>The story follows a young boy named Gon Freecss, who was told all his life that both his parents were dead.
        But when he learns from Kite, an apprentice of his father Ging Freecss, that he is still alive and has since
        become an accomplished Hunter, Gon leaves his home on Whale Island (くじら島, Kujira Tō) to take the Hunter
        Examination (ハンター試験, Hantā Shiken) in order to become a Hunter like him.[11][12][13] During the exam, Gon
        meets and befriends three of the other applicants: Kurapika, the last remaining member of the Kurta clan who
        wishes to become a Hunter in order to avenge his clan and recover their scarlet-glowing eyes that were
        plucked from their corpses by a band of thieves known as the Phantom Troupe; Leorio, a prospective physician
        who, in order to pay for medical school, desires the financial benefits that Hunters receive; and Killua
        Zoldyck, another twelve-year-old boy who has left his former life as a member of the world's most notorious
        assassin family.[12][13][5] Among many other examinees, Gon continuously encounters Hisoka, a mysterious and
        deadly transmuter who takes an interest in him. After many trials together, Gon and his friends end up
        passing the exam except for Killua, who fails after killing another applicant due to the influence of his
        brother, Illumi, and runs away to his family's estate in shame.

        After Gon and the others convince Killua to rejoin their side, Leorio and Kurapika depart temporarily for
        their own personal reasons, while Gon and Killua set for the Heavens Arena (天空闘技場, Tenkū Tōgijō), a
        skyscraper where thousands of martial artists compete daily in fighting tournaments, seeking to improve
        themselves and gain monetary rewards.[14] There they meet Zushi, a fellow Heavens Arena applicant, who has a
        kung fu master named Wing who trains them in utilizing Nen, a Qi-like life energy used by its practicers to
        manifest parapsychological abilities, and is also considered to be the final requirement to pass the Hunter
        Exam. Sometime later, Gon and his friends reunite again in Yorknew City (ヨークシンシティ, Yōkushin Shiti) where
        they have a clash with the Phantom Troupe. During the occasion, two from the band of thieves are killed by
        Kurapika and he is forced to give up the chance of hunting down the rest in order to rescue Gon and Killua
        from being captured, but not without succeeding in sealing the powers of their leader, Chrollo Lucilfer.

    <h2>production</h2>

    <P></P>
    Author Yoshihiro Togashi explained that one of his hobbies was collecting objects of all sorts, so he was
    inspired to create a manga involving collecting titled "(something) Hunter".[17] He came up with the final name
    Hunter × Hunter while watching the television variety show Downtown, in which the hosts often repeat what they
    say to make the audience laugh.[17] The "×" in the title is silent.[4][18][19] As with his previous series, YuYu
    Hakusho, Togashi used drafting ink and Kabura pens for his illustrations but began using an eMac to color
    them.[20] Togashi uses few or no assistants in the manga's production;[21] however, fellow manga artist and
    future wife Naoko Takeuchi assisted Togashi in adding screentone to single-color pages for the first
    volume.[22][23] With the birth of their first son early in its publication, Togashi felt that this personal
    aspect of his life would be a great influence on his work, particularly the manga's theme of a young boy
    searching for his father.[20]

    There have been several instances in which Togashi has apologized to readers in Shueisha's Weekly Shōnen Jump
    for low-quality artwork and promised to redraw portions of the chapters for their tankōbon (collected volume)
    releases.[24][25][26] In addition, the publication history of the Hunter × Hunter manga has been plagued with
    hiatuses since 2006, in which serialized chapters would be separated by extended periods of
    time.[27][28][29][30] After returning from a two-year-long hiatus in June 2014,[31] and joining the
    English-language Weekly Shonen Jump lineup, the manga went on another just two months later.[32] The series
    returned from this hiatus on April 18, 2016,[33] however, just over two months later, Hunter × Hunter began
    another hiatus on June 4, 2016.[34] It came back on June 26, 2017,[35] and just over two months later, on August
    31, the series went on hiatus again, planning to return by the end of that year.[36] The series came back on
    January 29, 2018,[37] before going on hiatus again on April 9 of the same year.[38] After a five-month hiatus,
    the manga resumed publication from September 22 to November 26, 2018, before entering another hiatus for four
    years, its longest one to date.[39][40][41]

    In May 2022, Togashi created a Twitter account where he teased that the series would resume publication.[42] In
    July 2022, Togashi revealed that he was unable to sit in a chair for two years due to his back and hip problems,
    but was able to resume drawing by doing so while laying down;[43] in August of the same year, Togashi posted on
    Twitter that he decided to increase his staff, adding that chapter 399's background effects were done according
    to his request and that chapter 400 would move forward after Togashi hands in his specifications for it.[44] The
    series resumed publication on October 24, 2022, after a three-year-and-eleven-month hiatus.[45][46][47] On
    December 26, 2022, it was announced that the manga would enter on hiatus. The Weekly Shōnen Jump editorial
    department published a letter which said that they had consulted with Togashi and decided that the manga should
    not follow a weekly serialized format going forward, and that once they know concrete details of its return and
    how it will be serialized, they will reveal the details in the magazine.[48] On March 9, 2023, Togashi tweeted
    that chapter 401 had been completed, but the form of publication has not been decided at the time.[49][50] On
    October 1 of the same year, Togashi made his first tweet in nearly seven months, which contained the phrase
    "Start over" in English, as well as an image depicting the bottom right corner of a page with a ruler
    below.[51][52]

    In November 2023, on TV Asahi's variety show Iwakura and Yoshizumi Show [ja], Togashi announced that he had
    planned four possible scenarios for the series' finale through a handwritten letter which was read aloud during
    the program.[53][54] Only the fourth abandoned ending ("ending D") was revealed, stating that it could be
    considered the ending in case he dies before finishing the manga. This ending takes place after a time skip,
    years into the future, featuring Gon's granddaughter, Gin. Togashi expressed a desire to create a satisfying
    enough conclusion so he would not have to resort to endings A, B, or C. Togashi stated that the readers'
    reactions would be 80% positive on ending A, even split on ending B, and 90% negative on ending C. While
    acknowledging ending A as a "safe", noncontroversial option, Togashi personally preferred ending C, despite
    expecting significant criticism from fans.[55]

    <h3>media</h3>

    <P>ritten and illustrated by Yoshihiro Togashi, Hunter × Hunter started its serialization in Shueisha's shōnen
        manga magazine Weekly Shōnen Jump on March 3, 1998.[b] Shueisha has compiled most of the chapters into
        individual tankōbon volumes. The first volume was released on June 4, 1998.[58] As of November 4, 2022,
        thirty-seven volumes have been released.[59] The series has also been published in a sōshūhen edition that
        aims to recreate the manga as it was originally serialized in Weekly Shōnen Jump in the same size and with
        the color pages. Eleven volumes were released between December 9, 2011, and April 18, 2014, covering up to
        the Election story arc.[60][61]

        In April 2005, Viz Media began publishing the manga in English in North America.[62] They market the series
        as part of their "Shonen Jump Advanced" line for older teens and young adults.[63] Thirty-six volumes have
        been released in North America as of August 6, 2019.[64] Viz included the Kurapika's Memories chapters in
        the December 17 and 24, 2012 issues of their digital English magazine Weekly Shonen Jump Alpha.[65] On April
        22, 2014, it was announced that Hunter × Hunter would be joining the digital English magazine Weekly Shonen
        Jump.[66]

        The manga has also been licensed and translated into multiple languages throughout Europe and other parts of
        Asia. For instance, it was serialized between 2001 and 2005 in Banzai!, a German version of Weekly Shōnen
        Jump.[67][68] </P>

    <h4>reception</h4>

    <p>The series ranked fourth on Takarajimasha's Kono Manga ga Sugoi! list of best manga of 2012.[153] In November
        2014, readers of Media Factory's Da Vinci magazine voted Hunter × Hunter as the eleventh Weekly Shōnen
        Jump's greatest manga series of all time.[154] In 2019, the series ranked seventh on Da Vinci's 19th annual
        "Book of the Year" list.[155] On TV Asahi's Manga Sōsenkyo 2021 poll, in which 150,000 people voted for
        their top 100 manga series, Hunter × Hunter ranked eleventh.[156]
        Sales

        The Hunter × Hunter manga has been largely commercially successful; having sold over 60.6 million collected
        volumes in Japan by February 2012, making it Shueisha's eighth best-selling manga series.[157] This number
        had grown to 66.3 million copies by 2014.[158] The manga had over 72 million copies in circulation by
        December 2018;[159] over 79 million copies in circulation by November 2021;[160] and over 84 million copies
        in circulation by July 2022.[161] Several individual volumes have topped Oricon's list of the best-selling
        manga in Japan during their release week; such as volumes 30 through 36.[162] Volumes 24, 27, and 30 through
        34 were some of the top-selling volumes for their respective years.[163] Hunter × Hunter was the eighth
        best-selling manga series of both 2012 and 2013, with 3.4 and 4.6 million copies sold those years
        respectively.[164][165] In North America, volumes 23 through 27 have ranked within the top 300 best-selling
