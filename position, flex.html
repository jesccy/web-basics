     HIRAGANA<br>
        Hiragana is a Japanese syllabary, part of the Japanese writing
        system, along with katakana as well as kanji.Hiragana is the basic Japanese phonetic alphabet. It represents
        every sound in the Japanese language. Therefore, you can theoretically write everything in hiragana. However,
        because Japanese is written with no spaces, this will create nearly indecipherable text.
